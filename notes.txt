hat TradingView error almost always means: you ended a line in the middle of an expression, and Pine doesn’t allow implicit “line continuation” the way Python/JS do.

In your snippet there are three separate problems:

Leading indentation
Pine is picky: if you indent a line without it being inside a block that expects indentation, you can get “end of line” weirdness. Your first line has a leading space.

Breaking a boolean expression across lines without wrapping
This is the big one. In Pine, if you want to split a long boolean across lines, you generally need to wrap the whole expression in parentheses (or keep it on one line).

A typo from copy/paste corruption
pivoerror$0tLowPrice is not a valid identifier. That alone will error (maybe not this specific message, but it’s definitely broken). It should presumably be pivotLowPrice.

Fix (keep it strict: one-line-per-expression, plain ASCII)
bool sufficientData = bar_index >= pivotLookbackInput * 2

bool bullishRegular = sufficientData and not na(pivotLowPrice) and not na(lastPivotLow) and pivotLowPrice > lastPivotLow and rsiPivotLow < lastRsiPivotLow

bool bearishRegular = sufficientData and not na(pivotHighPrice) and not na(lastPivotHigh)


That will eliminate the “end of line without line continuation” class of error immediately.

If you really want multi-line (safe version)
bool bullishRegular = (
     sufficientData
 and not na(pivotLowPrice)
 and not na(lastPivotLow)
 and pivotLowPrice > lastPivotLow
 and rsiPivotLow < lastRsiPivotLow
)
