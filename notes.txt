This is a sophisticated documentation ecosystem. It moves beyond simple "coding style" and addresses the structural and semantic risks unique to Pine Script (e.g., bar-state persistence, repainting, and broker-emulation discrepancies).The separation of a Quick Ref for workflow, a Manual for deep reasoning, and Standards for formatting is a professional-grade architecture.1. Structural StrengthsThe "Veto" on Ambiguity: Your standards for na handling and explicit variable initialization (avoiding var when simple assignment is safer) are excellent.Polarity Checks: The logic in the Quick Ref regarding Stop/Limit polarity is a frequent "silent killer" in retail scripts; having this as a top-tier check is a high-value move.Contextual Awareness: You distinguish between historical calculation and real-time execution, which is the primary source of "strategy leakage" (where backtests look better than reality).2. Recommended Additions (The "Gaps")While comprehensive, I see three areas where a "Quantitative Edge" script like the ES Fade might still be vulnerable based on these documents:A. The "Bar-Magnifier" Fallacy (Logic Check G1)In Pine Script, strategy.exit assumes the best-case scenario within a single bar unless "Bar Magnifier" is used.The Risk: If a 5-minute bar hits both your Stop Loss and Take Profit, Pine Script defaults to the "profitable" outcome.Recommendation: Add a standard requiring strategy.exit to be tested with the "High-Low" vs. "Close" execution logic toggle, or requiring a secondary validation script on a lower timeframe (e.g., 1m).B. The "request.security" Data Leakage (B4 Expansion)You mention lookahead, but there is a second risk: Data Alignment.The Risk: Pulling $TICK or $ADD can occasionally return na on the very first bar of the day or during holidays.Recommendation: Add a sanity check for Data Persistence: Ensure external security calls use a "fallback" or nz() to prevent the entire strategy logic from "freezing" when one data feed blips.C. Variable Persistence in "Loops"The Risk: If your ATR filter or $TICK count uses a for loop or a ta.sum inside a conditional, the state might not update as expected across bar closures.Recommendation: Add a "Memory Consistency" check—ensure that any function starting with ta. is called on every bar, not wrapped inside an if statement.3. Workflow Improvement SuggestionTo make the SANITY_CHECKS_QUICK_REF.md even more effective, consider a "Pre-Flight Label" standard:Standard 8.4: Every script must include a metadata block or a log output that explicitly prints the status of these checks (e.g., "ATR Filter: Active", "Slippage Penalty: 0.50pts"). This makes debugging screenshots significantly easier.Summary Table: Documentation AuditDocumentCurrent GradePrimary ValueSuggested PatchPINE_SCRIPT_STANDARDSAFormatting/PerformanceAdd ta. function scoping rules.SANITY_CHECKS_QUICK_REFA+Safety/PolarityAdd a check for "Bar Magnifier" logic.LOGICAL_SANITY_CHECKSADeep Logic/ReasoningExpand on request.security alignment.
