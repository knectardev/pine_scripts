➕ 1. Intent (single-select or short text)

This is more important than another metric.

Examples:

Mean reversion

Trend continuation

Regime filter

Veto / confirmation

Experimental

This lets you later answer questions like:

“Show me all mean-reversion strategies”
“Which scripts are veto-only?”

This field pays dividends fast.

➕ 2. Assumptions (short text / bullets)

This is not notes — it’s more specific.

Examples:

“RTH only (09:30–16:00 ET)”

“Requires overnight session”

“Fails on trend days”

“Designed for ES 5m”

This is where future-you avoids re-learning hard lessons.

➕ 3. Confidence / Maturity (enum)

Something like:

Draft

Paper-only

Validated

Retired

You already have Status, but status is operational; this is epistemic.

It answers:

“How much do I trust this idea?”
