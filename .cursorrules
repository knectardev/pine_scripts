# Pine Script TradingView Project Rules

## Project Overview
This project contains Pine Script files for TradingView platform, including indicators, strategies, and studies.

## Code Organization Rules

### File Structure
- Place all Pine Script files in appropriate subdirectories:
  - `/scripts/indicators/` - Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages, etc.)
  - `/scripts/strategies/` - Trading strategies with entry/exit logic
  - `/scripts/studies/` - Other analysis tools and custom studies
- Name files descriptively using lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `rsi-divergence-indicator.pine`)
- Each Pine Script file should be self-contained and ready to copy-paste into TradingView

### Pine Script Standards
- Always use Pine Script version 5 (`//@version=5`)
- Include comprehensive header comments with:
  - Script name and description
  - Author and version
  - Parameters and their purposes
  - Usage instructions
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Follow TradingView Pine Script style guide

### Metadata Management
- When creating or modifying Pine Scripts, update the corresponding JSON metadata in `/data/scripts.json`
- Include all required fields: id, name, type, version, description, parameters, backtest metrics (for strategies)
- Keep metadata synchronized with actual script files

### Documentation
- Document each script's purpose, inputs, and expected outputs
- Include usage examples and screenshots in `/docs/` when applicable
- Update README.md when adding new categories or significant features

## Version Control
- Commit Pine Script files with descriptive messages
- Include version numbers in scripts and increment on changes
- Tag releases with semantic versioning (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.)

## Testing & Validation
- Test all scripts in TradingView before committing
- Document backtest results for strategies in the JSON metadata
- Include performance metrics: win rate, profit factor, max drawdown, total trades
- Save backtest screenshots to `/docs/backtests/` folder

## Web Interface
- Keep the web interface synchronized with script metadata
- Ensure all new scripts appear in the searchable grid
- Update grid columns if new metadata fields are added

## AI Assistant Guidelines
- When creating new Pine Scripts, always create the corresponding JSON metadata entry
- When asked about backtest performance, refer to the data in scripts.json
- Suggest improvements based on TradingView best practices
- Help optimize scripts for better performance and readability
- Validate Pine Script syntax before saving files
